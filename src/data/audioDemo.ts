      { speaker: "ai", text: "I'm sorry to hear that. No hot water is never a great way to start the day. Thankfully, if your water heater is only five years old, it should still be under warranty. Just a few quick questions so I can help get the right technician to you as quickly as possible.", timestamp: 20 },
      { speaker: "ai", text: "Are you the homeowner or the person responsible for the property?", timestamp: 35 },

      { speaker: "client", text: "Great. How long do these diagnostics usually take? I'll need to notify my boss at work.", timestamp: 107 },
      { speaker: "ai", text: "Most diagnostic appointments take 30 to 60 minutes, depending on the issue. If a full repair is needed, the technician will let you know the estimated time and cost on site.", timestamp: 113 },
      { speaker: "client", text: "Okay, that's fine. Do I need to be home the whole time?", timestamp: 126 },
